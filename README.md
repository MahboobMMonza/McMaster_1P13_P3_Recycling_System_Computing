# 1P13 Project 3 Q-Bot Code

## McMaster University Engineering 1P13 Project 3 Mon&#8209;21 Computing Code

### Description

This is a repository for the code created and used in McMaster University
**Engineering 1P13 Project 3: Revenge of the Recycling System**. This code controls the Q-Arm and Q-Bot in the *Quanser
Interactive Labs Virtual Environment* and can be adapted to use with the corresponding hardware.

### Configuration

To utilize this code, ensure that a Raspberry Pi 4 is available with system specifications for hardware and software
meeting the minimum requirements outlined by McMaster University. Download and import [Common][8] and
[Student_Files][9] folders **only** to the Pi. Ensure that Quanser Interactive Labs simulation program is installed with
specifications outlined by McMaster University, or the corresponding hardware is present. Ensure IP address matches
computer IP address when using simulation.

To use the virtual system code, run [virtual_environment_code.py][1] when a connection to the simulation has been made.
To use and modify the physical environment code, switch to the "hardware" branch. The code is located inside
of [Student_Files][9] and is titled [physical_environment_code.py][10]. Note that the code is incomplete as further progress
for the integrated hardware bonus was ceased.
