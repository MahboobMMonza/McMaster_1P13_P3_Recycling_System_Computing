## McMaster University Engineering 1P13 Project 3 Mon&#8209;21 Computing Code

### Description

This is a repository for the code created and used in McMaster University
**Engineering 1P13 Project 3: Revenge of the Recycling System**. This code
controls the Q-arm and Q-bot in the *Quanser Labs Virtual Environment* and can
be adapted to use with the corresponding hardware.

### Configuration

To utilize this code, ensure that a Raspberry Pi 4 is available with system
specifications for hardware and software meeting the minimum requirements
outlined by McMaster University. Download and import _Common_ and
_Student_Files_ folders **only** to the Pi. Ensure that Quanser Interactive
Labs simulation program is installed with specifications outlined by McMaster
University, or the corresponding hardware is present. Ensure IP address matches
computer IP address when using simulation.

If using simulation, set [hardware][1] variable inside [project_sample.py][3] file
to **False**, and set it to **True** to use hardware.
